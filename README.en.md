This software is designed for data visualization.  
The basic set of modules includes:  
- Excel – a module for loading data from *.xlsx files.  

When launched, the program automatically searches for “report” files to load and visualize them. You can configure which modules should be run.  

Used libraries:  
- MAUI 10  
- R3  
- ObservableCollections  
- R3.MAUI  
- R3.ObservableCollections  
- Newtonsoft.Json  

The program is free for commercial use. Any ideas for improvements and fixes are welcome :)
